### 7. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?

```sql
WITH total_yearly_sales_cte AS (
	SELECT calendar_year, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
	FROM clean_weekly_sales
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 1
)
SELECT c.calendar_year, c.demographic, 
	ROUND((SUM(c.sales)::decimal / t.total_sales) * 100, 1) AS pcent_sales
FROM clean_weekly_sales c
JOIN total_yearly_sales_cte t
	ON c.calendar_year = t.calendar_year
GROUP BY c.calendar_year, c.demographic, t.total_sales
ORDER BY c.calendar_year, c.demographic;
```

#### Answer:

| calendar_year | demographic | pcent_sales |
| :-: | :-:| :-:|
| 2018|	"unknown"|	41.6|
| 2018|	Couples|	26.4|
| 2018|	Families|	32.0|
| 2019|	"unknown"|	40.3|
| 2019|	Couples|	27.3|
| 2019|	Families|	32.5|
| 2020|	"unknown"|	38.6|
| 2020|	Couples|	28.7|
| 2020|	Families|	32.7|

---

### 8. Which `age_band` and `demographic` values contribute the most to Retail sales?

```sql
SELECT c.age_band, c.demographic, 
	ROUND((SUM(c.sales)::decimal / 
		(SELECT SUM(sales)
		FROM clean_weekly_sales 
		WHERE platform = 'Retail')
	) * 100, 1) AS retail_sales_pcent
FROM clean_weekly_sales c
WHERE platform = 'Retail'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

#### Answer:

| age_band| demographic | pcent_sales |
| :-:| :-:| :-:|
| "unknown"| "unknown"|	40.5|
| Middle Aged|	Families|	27.7|
| Middle Aged|	Couples|	20.7|
| Young Adults|	Couples|	6.6|
| Young Adults|	Families|	4.5|

- The `"unknown"` category on both `age_band` and `demographic` contributes the most to Retail sales on an yearly basis.
- The known categories that contributed the most to Retail sales is the `Middle Aged` on `age_band` and `Families` from the `demographic`.

### 9. Can we use the `avg_transaction` column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?

```sql
SELECT calendar_year,
	platform,
	ROUND(SUM(sales)::decimal/SUM(transactions), 2) AS correct_avg_transact,
    ROUND(AVG(avg_transaction)::decimal, 2) AS incorrect_avg_transact
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

#### Answer:

- No, we can not use the `avg_transaction` column since it gives the average amount of sales per transaction for a specific record on a day. And an average of average will not give us the yearly average, but an average of averages. Example:

	| calendar_year | sales | transactions | avg_transaction |
	| :-: | :-:| :-:| :-:|
	| 2018-01-01 | 2+3+4+4+4+4+4+4 = 17 | 8 | 2.125 |
	| 2018-01-02 |	1+5+1+1+1 = 9| 5 | 1.8 |

	Average of averages: (2.125 + 1.8)/ 2 = 1.9

	Yearly average: (17 + 9)/ (8 + 5) = 2.9

- Here it is the final result, using the query above:

	| calendar_year | platform | correct_avg_transact | incorrect_avg_transact |
	| :-: | :-:| :-:| :-:|
	| 2018|	Retail|	36.56| 42.41|
	| 2018|	Shopify| 192.48| 187.80|
	| 2019|	Retail|	36.83| 41.47|
	| 2019|	Shopify| 183.36| 177.07|
	| 2020|	Retail|	36.56| 40.14|
	| 2020|	Shopify| 179.03| 174.40|
