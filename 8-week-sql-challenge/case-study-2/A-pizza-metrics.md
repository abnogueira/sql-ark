	FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders r
	JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders c
		ON r.order_id = c.order_id
	WHERE r.distance NOT LIKE 'null'
	GROUP BY r.order_id

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id
	, sum(CASE
		WHEN c.exclusions = 'null' AND c.extras = 'null' THEN 0
		WHEN c.exclusions <> '' OR c.extras <> '' THEN 1
		ELSE 0
	END) AS at_least_one_change
	, sum(CASE
		WHEN c.exclusions = 'null' AND c.extras = 'null' THEN 1
		WHEN (c.exclusions = '' OR c.exclusions IS NULL) AND (c.extras = '' OR c.extras IS NULL) THEN 1
		ELSE 0
	END) AS no_change
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders r
JOIN pizza_runner.customer_orders c
	ON r.order_id = c.order_id
WHERE r.distance NOT LIKE 'null'
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY c.customer_id;
```

#### Steps
After looking into the data of the column `exclusions` and `extras` on the table `customer_order`, which are column of type `VARCHAR`. It's possible to see when there are changes to the pizzas, there are one or several numbers separated by commas that indicate which changes to the pizzas were requested by the customer; on the other hand when no changes are requested the cells can be: empty, null as a string or NULL do type `NULL`.
- The expression `stringexpression = ''` yields:
   - `TRUE` for `''` (or for any string consisting of only spaces with the data type `char(n)`)
   - `NULL` for `NULL`
   - `FALSE` for anything else

#### Answer:
| customer_id | at_least_one_change | no_change |
| :- | :- | :- |
| 101 | 0 | 2 |
| 102 | 0 | 3 |
| 103 | 3 | 0 |
| 104 | 2 | 1 |
| 105 | 1 | 0 |

- Customers 101 and 102 order pizzas with their original recipes.
- Customer 103, 104 and 105 have requested at least once, a change on their pizza.
