## Solution - D. Extra Challenge Question

---

### 1. Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to implement - they want to calculate data growth using an interest calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have with a bank.

    If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?

    Special notes:

    - Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this calculation if you have the stamina!

#### Steps

In order to proceed with the resolution, I had to make assumptions regarding the calculation of the interest, that would be calculated on a daily basis. Here are the assumptions:

- The principal amount (meaning the initial amount) for the interest calculation will be the first deposit money, starting on that day.
- Since it requires a period of 24h in order to calculate the interest on a daily basis, if there is movement in the account, there is a penalty. I won't be calculating the interest of that day, since the money wasn't the same for 24 hours.

This challenge will be separated into two parts: data growth calculation using a daily simple interest rate  and data growth using a daily compouding interest rate.

How to calculate the daily data growth using a:
- daily simple interest rate: `prev_month_amount + principal_amount * AIR/365`;
- daily compounding interest rate: `prev_month_amount + prev_month_amount * AIR/365`;

where

- `prev_month_amount` is the balance amount of the previous month,
- `principal_amount` is the amount to be used for the calculation with the simple interest rate,
- `AIR` is the annual interest rate,
- `AIR/365` gives the daily interest rate.

#### Answer

Using a simple interest rate:

| txn_month | data_required_per_month |
| :- | -: |
| 1 | 556.83 |
| 2 | 1,008.58 |
| 3 | 1,083.96 |
| 4 | 1,121.34 |

Note: this is the sum of a simple interest rate. Technically, the real amount (adding the principal amount and subtracting withdraws) would be calculated after one year since this is a yearly interest rate.

Using a compound interest rate:

| txn_month | data_required_per_month |
| :- | -: |
| 1 | 294,326.86 |
| 2 | 9,678,947.24 |
| 3 | 13,498,385.04 |
| 4 | 16,758,187.85 |

Note: there aren't negative values, because when the balance is negative, the total is zero.
