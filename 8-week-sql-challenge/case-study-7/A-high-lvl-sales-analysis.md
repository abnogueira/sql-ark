# Case Study #7: Balanced Tree ðŸ¥¾

## Solution - A. High Level Sales Analysis Questions

The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.

Each question can be answered using a single query - but as you are writing the SQL to solve each individual problem, keep in mind how you would generate all of these metrics in a single SQL script which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.

```sql
SELECT SUM(s.qty) AS total_products,
    SUM(s.qty * s.price) AS total_revenue_wo_discounts,
    SUM(ROUND(s.qty * s.price * (s.discount/ 100.0), 2)) AS total_discounts
FROM balanced_tree.sales s
```

__Steps:__

- Since the `discount` attribute in `sales` table is a percentage, it's necessary to apply it over the full price of the item in order to get the discount amount. And then use `SUM` to get the total discount amount.

__Result:__

| total_products | total_revenue_wo_discounts | total_discounts |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 45216| 1289453| 156229.14|
