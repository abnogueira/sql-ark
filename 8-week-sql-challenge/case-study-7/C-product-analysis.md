# Case Study #7: Balanced Tree ü•æ

## Solution - C. Product Analysis Questions

The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.

Each question can be answered using a single query - but as you are writing the SQL to solve each individual problem, keep in mind how you would generate all of these metrics in a single SQL script which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.

### 6. What is the percentage split of revenue by product for each segment? & 9. What is the total transaction ‚Äúpenetration‚Äù for each product? (hint: penetration = number of transactions where at least 1 quantity of a product was purchased divided by total number of transactions)

```sql
SELECT segment_name,
    p.product_name,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*)::decimal/
        (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) FROM balanced_tree.sales), 2) AS penetration_pcent,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(s.qty * s.price) / SUM(SUM(s.qty * s.price)) 
        OVER(PARTITION BY segment_name), 2) AS revenue_split_pcent
FROM balanced_tree.sales s
JOIN balanced_tree.product_details p
    ON s.prod_id = p.product_id

### 10. What is the most common combination of at least 1 quantity of any 3 products in a 1 single transaction?

The solution to this question is based on the solution provided by muryulia in [here](https://github.com/muryulia/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%237%20-%20Balanced%20Tree%20Clothing%20Co./Solution.md#high-level-sales-analysis).

```sql
WITH cte_products AS(
    SELECT txn_id, product_name
    FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s
    JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
),
cte_prod_combinations AS (
    SELECT p.product_name AS product_1,
        p1.product_name AS product_2,
        p2.product_name AS product_3,
        COUNT(*) AS times_bought_together,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS combination_rank
    FROM cte_products AS p
    JOIN cte_products AS p1 ON p.txn_id = p1.txn_id
        AND p.product_name != p1.product_name
        AND p.product_name < p1.product_name
    JOIN cte_products AS p2 ON p.txn_id = p2.txn_id
        AND p.product_name != p2.product_name
        AND p1.product_name != p2.product_name
        AND p.product_name < p2.product_name
        AND p1.product_name < p2.product_name
    GROUP BY
        p.product_name,
        p1.product_name,
        p2.product_name
)
SELECT product_1, product_2, product_3,
    times_bought_together
FROM cte_prod_combinations
WHERE combination_rank = 1
```

__Steps:__

- The question requires the most common combination of at least 1 quantity of any 3 products in a 1 single transaction, which can be seen as finding the combination of 3 products bought together as many times as possible.
- Combination of 3 products within 12 possible products is actually C(12,3) = 220 possibilities. Since C(_n_, _r_) represents the combinations of _n_ (objects) choose _r_ (samples). First we need to create those combinations and count them.
- Create CTE named `cte_products`, which list a single product `product_name` that was bought with their associated transaction ID `txn_id`. This CTE will be used to feed another CTE.
- Create CTE named `cte_prod_combinations` which creates 220 combinations of 3 products using the information from `cte_products`. The `COUNT` function is used to count how many times the products were bought together, and then `ROW_NUMBER` is used to rank the combinations, in order to get the most bought one.

__Answer:__

| product_1 | product_2 | product_3 | times_bought_together |
| :- | :- | :- | :-: |
| Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens| Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens| White Tee Shirt - Mens| 352|

- The most bought combination is Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens, Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens and White Tee Shirt - Mens.
