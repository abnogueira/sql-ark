# Case Study #7: Balanced Tree ðŸ¥¾

## Solution - D. Reporting Challenge Questions

Write a single SQL script that combines all of the previous questions into a scheduled report that the Balanced Tree team can run at the beginning of each month to calculate the previous monthâ€™s values.

Imagine that the Chief Financial Officer (which is also Danny) has asked for all of these questions at the end of every month.

He first wants you to generate the data for January only - but then he also wants you to demonstrate that you can easily run the same analysis for February without many changes (if at all).

Feel free to split up your final outputs into as many tables as you need - but be sure to explicitly reference which table outputs relate to which question for full marks.

### Steps

- To generate data for January (of 2021) only - run script `D-reporting-challenge-jan.sql`, which is an adptation of the generic script built to run monthly, but this will run just for january of 2021. View the complete syntax in [here][1].
- In order to run the same analysis for any previous month without changing anything run script `D-reporting-challenge.sql`. View the complete syntax in [here][2].
