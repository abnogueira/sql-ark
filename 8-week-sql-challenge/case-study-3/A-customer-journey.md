### 1. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the `subscriptions` table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey. Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of `join` to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id, s.start_date, p.plan_name, p.price
FROM 
	foodie_fi.subscriptions s
	JOIN foodie_fi.plans p
		ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id, s.start_date, p.plan_name, p.price
HAVING customer_id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date;
```

#### Steps:
- Use **COUNT** to find out the number of ordered pizzas (`total_pizzas`).

#### Answer:
| customer_id | start_date | plan_name | price |
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
