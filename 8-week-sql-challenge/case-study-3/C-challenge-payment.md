### 1. The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS payments;
SELECT
  customer_id,
  plan_id,
  plan_name,
  payment_date ::date :: varchar,
  CASE
    WHEN LAG(plan_id) OVER (
      PARTITION BY customer_id
      ORDER BY
        plan_id
    ) != plan_id
    AND DATE_PART(
      'day',
      payment_date - LAG(payment_date) OVER (
        PARTITION BY customer_id
        ORDER BY
          plan_id
      )
    ) < 30 THEN amount - LAG(amount) OVER (
      PARTITION BY customer_id
      ORDER BY
        plan_id
    )
    ELSE amount
  END AS amount,
  RANK() OVER(
    PARTITION BY customer_id
    ORDER BY
      payment_date
  ) AS payment_order 
  
INTO TEMP TABLE payments
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      customer_id,
      s.plan_id,
      plan_name,
      generate_series(
        start_date,
        CASE
          WHEN s.plan_id = 3 THEN start_date
          WHEN s.plan_id = 4 THEN NULL
          WHEN LEAD(start_date) OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id
            ORDER BY
              start_date
          ) IS NOT NULL THEN LEAD(start_date) OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_id
            ORDER BY
              start_date
          )
          ELSE '2020-12-31' :: date
        END,
        '1 month' + '1 second' :: interval
      ) AS payment_date,
      price AS amount
    FROM
      foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
      JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE
      s.plan_id != 0
      AND start_date < '2021-01-01' :: date
    GROUP BY
      customer_id,
      s.plan_id,
      plan_name,
      start_date,
      price
  ) AS t
ORDER BY
  customer_id

SELECT * FROM payments;
```

#### Steps

- Select values into a temporary table called `payments` using the **SELECT INTO** statement.
- Recurring payments are created using **GENERATE_SERIES()** function, previous and next values are validated with **LAG()** and **LEAD()** window functions.
	- For *pro annual* plan, the `payment_date` happens once, which is the date of the actual payment.
	- For *churn* plan: no data will be generated, since there isn't a payment. 
	- For monthly plans: if a customer kept payments longer than 2020, the generated data will end at `2020-12-31`, since the table will only have 2020 data.
	- These data will be generated using an interval of 1 month with an added second to prevent double payments between two plans, I added 1 second for each recurrent payment, it adds a maximum of 12 seconds per one year. To check how many days passed between two payments, we calculate the difference between the two dates. If the difference is below 30, we deduct the amount paid from the new plan payment.
- Regarding the `amount` column:
	- If a customer upgrades their plan during their current payment period, we need to count the difference between their current plan and the new plan. For example, customer #16 paid for their basic monthly plan on October 10 and upgraded to an annual pro plan on October 21. We deduct their annual payment from the amount of their basic monthly payment: 199 - 9.9 = 189.1
	- But if they upgrade their plans in the next payment period, we need to count one payment only. For example, customer #19 paid for their pro monthly plan on July 29 and upgraded to an annual plan on August 29. We count each payment separately and we need to avoid double payments.

#### Answer:

Top 16 customers information of `payments` table:
